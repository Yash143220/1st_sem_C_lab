How to create a variable of a user defined data type like structure 

Method 1:

create the variable by writing a variable name before semicolon where structure is defined.


#include <stdio.h>

struct student{
    int roll;
    int marks;
};





Method 2:

Use a variable name in the main using syntax struct structure_name structure_variable

eg.

struct student str1;


#include <stdio.h>

struct student{
    int roll;
    int marks;
}str1;

void main()
{
    struct student str1;

    printf("Pls Enter the student roll number:");
    scanf("%d",&str1.roll);
    printf("Pls Enter the student marks:");
    scanf("%d",&str1.marks);

    printf("Student roll %d and marks %d",str1.roll, str1.makrs);
}
